## Brief Bio

---



Hien Nguyen holds dual positions as an Associate Professor at La Trobe University in Australia and a Professor at the Institute of Mathematics for Industry at Kyushu University in Japan. His role focuses on building collaborative relationships between the two institutions and the two countries at large to foster new innovative research in mathematical and computational statistics, as well as the applications of such developments. Hien also holds an Honorary Associate Professorship at his Alma Mater, the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, where he continues to supervise students.

Hien has a strong interest in the research of computational statistics and its interaction with the fields of machine learning and AI. His research focuses on the analysis of large datasets that are acquired incrementally or are too large for conventional computers. In such settings, his work centers around the use of methods such as stochastic optimization theory and Bayesian inference to handle such difficulties. He is also interested in the development of rigorous statistical tools for choosing between models when data are complex and for testing the validity of such choices, as well as providing confidence statements regarding the goodness of inferential decisions in practice.

Hien's methods have found applications in multiple areas of applied research, including neuroimaging, agriculture, genetics and genomics, proteomics, quantum computing, economics, public policy, and social sciences. Outside of his work, Hien Nguyen currently serves as the President of the Queensland Branch of the Statistical Society of Australia and holds various editorial roles for the society's journal, the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics.

In his free time, Hien Nguyen enjoys bushwalking and spending time with his three cats: Nyx, Penelope, and Beau.

### Roles

* Professor at the Institute of Mathematics for Industry, Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan (2023--Present)
* Associate Professor at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia (2023--Present)
* Honorary Associate Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia (2023--Present).
* President of the Statistical Society of Australia, Queensland Branch (2023--Present)
* Handling Editor (Book Reviews) and Associate Editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics (2019--Present).
* Technical Editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics (2018--Present).

### Major Projects

**ARC DP230100905 (with Xin Guo, UQ; Florence Forbes, Inria; Gersende Fort, IMT): Stochastic majorization--minimization algorithms for data science.**

*2023--2025*

* The proposed project aims to study the family of stochastic majorisation-minimisation algorithms for the computation of inferential quantities in an incremental manner. These algorithms can be used to produce feasible and practical algorithms for complex models, both current and future. The project will develop new frameworks for constructing algorithms that allow for rapid, accurate, and robust inference of large, complex datasets. These tools will support practitioners in various fields, such as logistics, business analysis, economics, and meteorology, to make fast decisions with greater confidence. The algorithms developed will be universal and can be applied in many data analytic settings. They will be distributed widely via convenient and adaptable software in open-source repositories.

### Past Projects

**ARC DP180101192 (with Geoff McLachlan, UQ; and Sharon Lee, UQ): Classification methods for providing personalised and class decisions.**

*2018â€“2022*

* The project provided a novel approach to clustering multivariate samples on entities in a class that automatically matched the sample clusters across the entities. The project aimed to develop a mixture-model-based framework for simultaneous clustering with inter-sample variation in a class and for matching the clusters across the entities. The statistical approach automatically matched the clusters, and the overall mixture model provided a template for the class. The project was useful for biological image analysis and data analysis in flow cytometry.

**ARC DE170101134: Feasible algorithms for big inference.**

*2017-2020*

* The project aimed to develop algorithms for computationally-intensive statistical tools to analyse Big Data. Big Data is widely used in various fields, but requires specialized machine learning methods for accurate inferential analysis. Many traditional tools of statistical inference are inadequate due to computational limitations. The project focused on developing tools such as false discovery rate control, heteroscedastic and robust regression, and mixture models, using optimization and composite-likelihood estimation techniques appropriate for Big Data. The project aimed to make the resulting software openly available for scalable and distributable analysis of Big Data. The outcome was a suite of scalable algorithms for analyzing Big Data.
