## Brief Bio

---

Hien Nguyen is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Queensland who specializes in optimization algorithms for complex and heterogeneous statistical and machine learning models, as well as inferential tools for such models. His research has been applied in neuroimaging, agriculture, genetics, proteomics, economics, and public health. He previously worked at La Trobe University as a Senior Lecturer and served as an SSA Vic Council member in 2021. From 2017 to 2020, he was an ARC DECRA Fellow, and he currently serves as the Statistical Computing and Technical Editor for the society's journal: The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics. In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his two cats, Nyx and Penelope.

### Roles

* Senior Lecturer at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia (2021--Present)
* Adjunct Senior Lecturer at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia (2021--Present).
* Handling Editor (Statistical Computing) and Associate Editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics (2019--Present).
* Technical Editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics (2018--Present).

### Major Projects

**ARC DP230100905 (with Xin Guo, UQ; Florence Forbes, Inria; Gersende Fort, IMT): Stochastic majorization--minimization algorithms for data science.**

*2023--2025*

* The proposed project aims to study the family of stochastic majorisation-minimisation algorithms for the computation of inferential quantities in an incremental manner. These algorithms can be used to produce feasible and practical algorithms for complex models, both current and future. The project will develop new frameworks for constructing algorithms that allow for rapid, accurate, and robust inference of large, complex datasets. These tools will support practitioners in various fields, such as logistics, business analysis, economics, and meteorology, to make fast decisions with greater confidence. The algorithms developed will be universal and can be applied in many data analytic settings. They will be distributed widely via convenient and adaptable software in open-source repositories.

### Past Projects

**ARC DP180101192 (with Geoff McLachlan, UQ; and Sharon Lee, UQ): Classification methods for providing personalised and class decisions.**

*2018-–2022*

* The project provided a novel approach to clustering multivariate samples on entities in a class that automatically matched the sample clusters across the entities. The project aimed to develop a mixture-model-based framework for simultaneous clustering with inter-sample variation in a class and for matching the clusters across the entities. The statistical approach automatically matched the clusters, and the overall mixture model provided a template for the class. The project was useful for biological image analysis and data analysis in flow cytometry.

**ARC DE170101134: Feasible algorithms for big inference.**

*2017-–2020*

* The project aimed to develop algorithms for computationally-intensive statistical tools to analyse Big Data. Big Data is widely used in various fields, but requires specialized machine learning methods for accurate inferential analysis. Many traditional tools of statistical inference are inadequate due to computational limitations. The project focused on developing tools such as false discovery rate control, heteroscedastic and robust regression, and mixture models, using optimization and composite-likelihood estimation techniques appropriate for Big Data. The project aimed to make the resulting software openly available for scalable and distributable analysis of Big Data. The outcome was a suite of scalable algorithms for analyzing Big Data.
